Full-stack software engineer with a front end focus. Functional programming fanatic. Built with [open-source software](https://github.com/okwolf).

I have led multiple teams of 4-8 developers, presented for groups of 50-100, and mentored more people than I can count. Software is an integral part of my daily life, both professionally and personally. I'm constantly learning what's new in my field, building solutions to all the problems I encounter, and enabling those around me to do the same.

## projects

### [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev)

Purely functional, declarative web apps in JavaScript. Functional state management included. I keep the core library fast and started a pattern for effects that later became part of the core. I publish a [library of effects](https://github.com/okwolf/hyperapp-fx) that make it do useful stuff.

### [tead](https://github.com/teadjs/tead)

Simple unit testing for JavaScript using [tests as data](/ban-software-defects#enter-tests-asdata).

### [paltry](https://github.com/paltry/paltry)

Paltry creates and updates a portable development environment for recent Windows installs. You might want this if your account doesn't have admin permissions, to avoid interfering with any software installed on the system, or to apply the best practices of DevOps to your development environment. Setup a new machine in minutes instead of hours and keep it up-to-date just as easily.
